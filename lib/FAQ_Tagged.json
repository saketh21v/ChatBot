            "ques": "How long does a Dell laptop battery last? When should I consider replacing mine?",
            "answer": "All rechargeable batteries wear out with time and usage.  As time and cumulative use increase, the performance will degrade. For the typical user, noticeable reduction in run time generally will be observed after 18 to 24 months.  For a power user, reduction in run time generally may be experienced prior to 18 months. We recommend buying a new Dell laptop battery when the run time does not meet your needs. ",

            "answer": "Higher Watt hours (Whr) on the same system under the same operating conditions will generally deliver longer battery run time.  For example, if you compare the same system, running the same applications, the 53Whr battery would provide approximately 65% more run time than the 32Whr battery.",

This includes AC adapters and laptop security carts plugged into an outlet. Laptop batteries, including those stored in laptop systems, should maintain an Operational Storage Temperature of 0  to 35 C (32  to 95 F). Batteries may be stored in the laptop or outside of the laptop.Charge batteries before storing. The recommended charging time should not exceed 1 hour.  Typically, this should charge the battery to between 80% and 100%.  (Some discharge will take place over time.  Stored batteries are expected to discharge 10-15% over a four month period, for your information.)",

If the battery supports ExpressChargeT, the battery typically will have greater than 80% charge after about an hour of charging with the system off, and fully charge in about 2 hours with the system off.   Batteries that do not support ExpressChargeT typically charge in about 3 hours with the system off.  See your system's user's manual for more information.",
